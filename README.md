# Detecting Adversarial Samples through Sharpness of Loss Landscape

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

**Zheng, Rui, et al. "Detecting Adversarial Samples through Sharpness of Loss Landscape." Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023. 2023.**

## Introduction

This repository provides the implementation for detecting adversarial samples using the sharpness of the loss landscape as described in the paper. The methods proposed in this paper aim to detect adversarial examples effectively and can be adapted to various frameworks.

## Repository Structure

- **adv_detect.py**: The main entry point of the program.
- **new_eye.py**: Contains the proposed method for detecting adversarial samples, which can be adapted to fit other frameworks.
- **eye.py**: Contains experimental attempts and other methods explored during the research.
